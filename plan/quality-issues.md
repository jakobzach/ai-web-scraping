---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Suspected Root causes for issues

### 1. **Careers pages not found reliably**
- Sometimes confused with Company News pages. 
- It should be easy to detect titles like "Jobs" or "WILLKOMMEN IM TEAM!" as bad data -> these were pulled from pages that were incorrectly identified as careers pages.

### 2. **If Careers page was found, the scraper does not click on single job listings to see all information about it**

### 3. **Lack of scraped content validation**
- Especially problematic if careers page was misidentified

## üö® Critical Issues

### 1. **Null/Invalid Descriptions**
**Severity**: High  
**Count**: 18 jobs affected

**Examples**:
- Adelbert Haas LLC jobs: All 10 jobs have `"description": "null"` (literal string)
- AFOTEK jobs: 8 jobs have `"description": "null"` (literal string)

**Impact**: Frontend will display "null" as job description text

### 2. **Missing Required Fields**
**Severity**: High  
**Count**: Multiple jobs affected

**Missing Descriptions**:
- Aachener Maschinenbau: `"description": ""` (empty string)
- Multiple AFOTEK jobs: Missing descriptions entirely
- AERO-LIFT jobs: Missing descriptions

**Missing Locations**:
- Aconity3D jobs: All 4 jobs missing location
- ACSYS jobs: Most jobs missing location
- Multiple other companies

### 3. **Invalid/Unusable URLs**
**Severity**: Medium-High  
**Count**: Multiple jobs affected

**Examples**:
- Aachener Maschinenbau: `"url": "/jobs"` (relative path, not actionable)
- Active Fiber Systems: `"url": "/offene-stellen"` (relative path)
- AEL Apparatebau: `"url": "Hier zu unseren offenen Stellen"` (button text, not URL)
- AGTOS: `"url": "MEHR ERFAHREN"` (button text, not URL)

### 5. **Generic/Non-Specific Job Titles**
**Severity**: Medium  
**Count**: 8+ jobs affected

**Examples**:
- "Jobs" (Aachener Maschinenbau) - too generic
- "Offene Stellen" (Active Fiber Systems) - means "Open Positions"

- "Arbeiten bei AFOTEK" - means "Working at AFOTEK"

### 6. **Duplicate Job Entries**

**Examples**:
- Active Fiber Systems: Same "Offene Stellen" job appears twice (IDs: f38ef604, f82d4011)
- ADVANTEC: Same jobs appear twice with different IDs
- AGTOS: Same 3 jobs appear twice (pagination issue)

### 7. **Job Type Classification Issues**
**Severity**: Medium  
**Count**: 40+ jobs affected

**Issues**:
- Most jobs missing `type` field (shows as `undefined`)
- ACSYS jobs incorrectly classified as "Internship" when they should be "Full-time"
- Only Adelbert Haas and some ACSYS jobs have proper type classification

## üîß Minor Issues

### 8. **Inconsistent URL Protocols**
**Severity**: Low  
**Count**: Multiple jobs

**Issues**:
- Some URLs use careers page fallback correctly

### 9. **Description Truncation**
**Severity**: Low  
**Count**: 2 jobs

**Examples**:
- ADVANTEC jobs: Descriptions end with "..." or "[mehr]" indicating truncation

### 10. **Inconsistent Location Formats**
**Severity**: Low  
**Count**: Multiple jobs

**Examples**:
- "Aachen, Germany" vs "Trossingen, Deutschland" vs "Charlotte, NC, USA"
- Mixed language formats for country names
